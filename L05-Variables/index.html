            1. we can't use special words as verialble 
            2. let let = 3 (gives error)
            3. can't start with number and special character
            4. only one console.log in one line 

            5. we can't re-create the the variable with same name 
            but we can re assign the another value to the same variable 

            ex. let varr = 3;
                let varr = 4; (this gives error) //re-creation 

                but 

                let varr = 3;
                varr = 4; (this is fine) //re-assign variable
        */

        // It is most secure way to use const 
        // best practice to use const as default 
        // and only give the let when needed
